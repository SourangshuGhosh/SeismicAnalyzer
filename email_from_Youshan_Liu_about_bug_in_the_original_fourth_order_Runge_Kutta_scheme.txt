Dear Prof.  Komatitsch,


         Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Youshan Liu,
         and I am a doctor student at Institute of Geology and Geophysics of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

         Ocassionally, I read your code of CPML software package (seismic_ADEPML_2D_elastic_RK4_eighth_order).

         Unfortunately, I found that your code with Runge-Kutta scheme may be not correct.

         For ordinary equation:

              y'(x) = f(x,y).

         The Runge-Kutta integration include the following four steps:

               y_n+1 = y_n + h/6*( K_1 + 2*K_2 + 2*K_3 + K_4)

               K_1 = f(x_n, y_n)

               K_2 = f(x_n + h/2, y_n + h/2*K_1)

               K_3 = f(x_n + h/2, y_n + h/2*K_2)

               K_4 = f(x_n + h  , y_n + h*K_3)

        In your code, K_inc stored in dvx(2,:,:). You may miss the proccess of the linear combination of y_n+1 = y_n + h/6*( K_1 + 2*K_2 + 2*K_3 + K_4).

        Although you defined the coefficient of the Runge-Kutta stored in array rk42, you never use them.

        I have modified your code, and I send you.

        I think that your code may be not correct !

        I run the your code and your code modified by me with the identical parameters.

        Your results may be not correct.

        When I set the time interval dt = 3ms (Courant number is 0.8485), your original code is unstable, while your code modified me still work.

        The results have been uploaded in attachment. The su format files can be opened by Fimage.exe.

        In addition, your code titled by seismic_ADEPML_2D_viscoelastic_RK4_eighth_order may be also not correct.


      I also improve the code to save much more memory.

      I think the arrays of memory_dvx_dx, etc. can be allocated only in two dimension.

      I have try them again.

      It still work. Unfortunately, I check the original code several times. I found that it may be incorrect.

      The original coed can not work with the time interval of 3 ms.

      The modified code can work with the time interval of 3 ms.


        Best wishes,

        Youshan LiuS
